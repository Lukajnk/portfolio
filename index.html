                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    Name: Luka Jankovic<br>
                    Date of birth: 27 February 1998<br>
                    Place of birth: Rotterdam, The Netherlands<br><br>
                    I am a Computer Science student at Hogeschool Rotterdam, a University of Applied Sciences.
                    At the same time I have an internship at Paramander. Paramander is a web-development agency located in Delft.<br><br>
                    I have fair knowlege over a variety of programing languages such as;<br>
                    &emsp;- C / C++<br>
                    &emsp;- Python<br>
                    &emsp;- Javascript<br>
                    &emsp;- PHP<br>
                    &emsp;- SQL<br><br>
                    Next to programming I can create websites and 3D models.

                <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
                <p>
                    Gaming<br>
                    Video games are the thing that got me into computers in the first place, I have been playing games since I was a little child and as I grew I became more curious of how the computer works and what you can create with it.<br><br>
                    3D modelling<br>
                    As I became more interested in creating my own game I started off by learning how to create 3D models. Since the closest thing to a "player" are the graphics I thought this is the greatest part of creating video games.<br><br>
                    Programming<br>
                    Soon, I realized 3D modelling is important but not even close to being as important as the structure of code that lies under every game. I started programming in C++ because I had a lot of controll and could learnt the fundamentals of every programming language easier.<br><br>
                    Maths<br>
                    Since elementary school Maths has been my favorite subject in school. Sometimes I like to play with the rules of math in my free time and discover new things.<br><br>
                    Chess<br>
                    I have learned to play chess when I was very young and it was always a fun game for me. Nowadays I play it on an app for my phone where I can play live with other players across the world.<br><br>
